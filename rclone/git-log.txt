    selfupdate: fix "invalid hashsum signature" error
    
    This was caused by a change to the upstream library
    ProtonMail/go-crypto checking the flags on the keys more strictly.
    
    However the signing key for rclone is very old and does not have those
    flags. Adding those flags using `gpg --edit-key` and then the
    `change-usage` subcommand to remove, save, quite then re-add, save
    quit the signing capabilities caused the key to work.
    
    This also adds tests for the verification and adds the selfupdate
    tests into the integration test harness as they had been disabled on
    CI because they rely on external sources and are sometimes unreliable.
    
    Fixes #7373

    build: fix docker build running out of space
    
    This removes some unused SDKs from the build machine to free some
    space up before building. It also adds some lines to show the free
    space.
